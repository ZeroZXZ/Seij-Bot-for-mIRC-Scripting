Instructions: First these files must be put into the default mIRC
scripting folder. Once you have mIRC open, you can press alt+r to access
the scripting editor on it, and right at the bottom you can find it's
default directory string.

Caution: These two files will override the respective default mIRC
Scripting functions for aliases.ini and remote.ini files only! So if you
already have any scripts, you might as well just copy&paste the code on
it.
